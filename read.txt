The json file:
it is my configuration file.
i cannot add any comment in my json file. any comment added will be read as a data.
i have mentioned the key -> dependencies, and will mention dependencies to be used by my project.
in order to run my app correctly, i need a copy of -> express, * -> any version of express
put a comma after, to add one more section.
i mention scripts -> start : so whenever i call start script it will run my index.js file.

The index.js file:
i have added comments.

what we define in dockerfile is how the node js app will work.
How Node JS apps work:
1. have to install dependencies before running the app.
  dependencies are installed by running 'npm install'
2. have to run a command to start up a server
  start server by running 'npm start'

i will build my docker image by creating a tag. so that i don't have to mention the container id
everytime to build the image.

i will run my image first time by setting up a container port-mapping.
